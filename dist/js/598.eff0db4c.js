There was great profit awaiting those who, in addition to passengers, could ship Swedish cattle and oats to a British market that craved such goods. At the same time, Wilson attempted to capitalize on the mail traffic to and from Göteborg, and to the city of Christiania (Oslo), Norway. Once his son John West Wilson had established himself in Göteborg, business quickly grew and, in 1850, the Wilson Line gained a permanent contract for mail forwarding with both Swedish and Norwegian authorities who, in turn, guaranteed him certain free harbor rights.<br>   </p><p align="justify">     At this time, most of the emigrant traffic from northern Europe was funneled through <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Liverpool</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Hamburg</span>, <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Bremen</span>, and several other ports, to which passengers would be carried indirectly from smaller port cities. John West Wilson realized that his line could become the freight link between Sweden and Liverpool and, thus, he began increasing passenger traffic by selling tickets that included train travel from Hull to Liverpool and then by ship across the Atlantic. To accomplish this, he signed agreements with approximately one dozen British passenger lines in Liverpool. Wilson&#39;s &quot;green ships,&quot; which once a week dominated the view of the Göta River in Göteborg, thereby became known as &quot;America boats.&quot; Two steamships were started in partnered traffic so that boats sailed from Göteborg and Hull at the same time. In England, the ships were dubbed &quot;Wilson&#39;s parrots&quot; because their names all ended in &quot;o,&quot; as in Rollo, Hero, Airosto, and <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Romeo</span>. Ships as large as Wilson&#39;s parrots were forced to anchor out from the &quot;America Pier,&quot; from which emigrants and freight were ferried by barge or launch. It was not until the 1880s that the Göta River was dredged to accommodate larger ships.<br>   </p><p align="justify">     As early as 1852, a group of 250 Swedes sailed on Wilson&#39;s mail boats, which from 1866 on, according to John West Wilson&#39;s own self-serving calculations, dominated emigrant traffic from Göteborg. From 1872 to 1880, nearly all Swedish emigrants traveled to Hull, and it is estimated that approximately eighty percent of all Swedish emigrants who came through Göteborg during the decade of the 1880s embarked on the &quot;green ships.&quot;<br> According to advertisements in the 1870s, the Wilson Line ships departed &quot;every Friday evening following the arrival of the express train from Stockholm.&quot; During the 1880s, the departures were changed to 1:00 p.m. The usual duration of the trip was two days, so passengers arrived at Hull on Sunday afternoon. During the intensive emigration of the 1880s, when some 325.000 emigrants departed, extra trips were required to handle the large number of passengers; some weeks during the spring saw as many as four large ships sailing from the Custom House pier. In May, 1881, nearly 9.000 emigrants sailed on fourteen boats from Göteborg, 2.650 of those on May 6 and 7. On April 14 of the following year, Rollo steamed out with 1.000 passengers, Orlando with 853, and a competitor, Marsden, with 934 on board - 2.783 emigrants in one day!<br>   </p><p align="justify">     Such figures bear witness to the mass exodus that passed down Sillgatan during the heavy emigration months of springtime. Not surprisingly, Wilson&#39;s little fleet had to be continually expanded! Consequently, in April, 1881, the newly-built <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Romeo</span> went into service with room for 1.000 third-class passengers who were offered &quot;previously unknown&quot; comforts. <span style="background-color:#ffff00;">Romeo</span> was apparently twice the size of Hero, which in 1866 could carry 550 passengers and was fitted with movable cattle stalls on the underdeck. The huge export of cattle plagued the emigrants for years with the foul smell, which old Swedish-Americans used to associate with the North Sea boats. </p><b><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sillgatan</p></b><p align="justify"><b><img border="0" src="'+n+'" width="400" height="263"></b><br>     In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Nordstaden (North Side) section of Göteborg was characterized by the ever-increasing emigrant flow, especially Sillgatan (Herring Street) which ran between Central Station, the terminus of the western mainline of the railroad, completed in 1862, and Custom House Square with its &quot;America Pier.&quot; This was also a good central location for those arriving by boat on the inner city canals. This street, with its flavor of Göteborg&#39;s earliest years, was first called Heringgatan, a name given by the town&#39;s many Dutch and Germans with allusions to the active herring fishing of the time. For those who wished to do business with emigrants, and especially the emigrant agents, it was absolutely necessary to have an office on or near Sillgatan. </p><p align="justify">     The local agents, who often were well-respected men in their communities, had all the brochures and timetables that the general agents produced and distributed. They were also often backed by extensive advertising in the newspapers. Agents&#39; operations were constantly watched by both the authorities and competitors; the slightest misstep could be reported, thereby costing the general agent thousands of crowns in fines. In 1883, authorities forbade the use of any emigrant propaganda produced outside of Sweden, a further incentive for agents to abide by the lows. Such alert oversight led to a continual self policing of the emigrant business which meant that emigrants could, as a rule, trust the agents.<br><br>     The emigrant regulations of 1869 appeared to leave few duties to the general agents in Göteborg other than to fill out, in duplicate, the exit contracts and emigrant registers and, at the stipulated time, submit them to the police who would check off names as the emigrants boarded ship. In reality, however, the general agent and his assistants had a long list of other, usually high-revenue producing, activities. For example, to engender trust the agent would see to it that emigrants were met at the train by a uniformed representative of the line. Once the groups were gathered together, they were marched in single file to various emigrant lodgings. Fr those particularly in danger of getting lost, the agents would get a long rope and tell the innocents to hold on as long as the rope moved. Due to rumors that the ticket price would be lower if one dealt with the general agent in person, many emigrants arrived to Göteborg without their prepayment receipt. Often there would be a tug-of-war in front of the Central Station for these &quot;unpropertied&quot; emigrants, and it was not uncommon for agents to get into fisticuffs over them. Occasionally a representative would resolutely take an emigrant by the collar and drag him or her away to &quot;the right&quot; flock! </p><p align="justify">     Accommodations cost twenty-five öre, &quot;including bed with sheets and blankets, coffee and rusks in the morning.&quot; Agents also concerned themselves with the emigrants&#39; leisure time. At one emigrant hotel, for example, an &quot;American language school&quot; was arranged, and one could also study models of the ships that awaited in Liverpool to cross the Atlantic with Swedes on board.<br><b></b></p><p align="justify"><b> </b></p><b><p align="justify">Hotel In Sillgatan</p></b><p align="justify"><b></b><img border="0" src="'+i+'" width="266" height="421"></p>',13);function h(e,t,a,n,i,h){const l=(0,o.up)("MiniNav"),d=(0,o.up)("BackToTop");return(0,o.wg)(),(0,o.iD)(o.HY,null,[(0,o._)("div",r,[(0,o.Wm)(l),s]),(0,o.Wm)(d)],64)}var l=a(6211),d=a(4637),g={components:{BackToTop:l.Z,MiniNav:d.Z}},u=a(89);const c=(0,u.Z)(g,[["render",h]]);var f=c}}]);
