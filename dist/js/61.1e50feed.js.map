Records indicate that he was born on\r\n        Thursday, April 30<sup>th</sup> 1863. He was born in Svenshult. This would be the\r\n        farm that his family lived on. Which is located in the parish of Hinneryd.\r\n        Hinneryd lies in the county of Kronoberg. And Kronoberg is one of three counties\r\n        in the province of Småland. In the southern part of Sweden. His parents were Johan\r\n        Nilsson and Karna Persdotter. They were 'Sharecroppers'. Working the land for a\r\n        wealthy land owner. And in return, given a cottage and a parcel of land to work\r\n        for themselves. When Nils turned 18 or 19 he was more than likely conscripted into\r\n        the military. Back in the 1800's it was mandatory. Much like our 'draft' we had in\r\n        the United States. After his time in the military he returned home and he lived\r\n        with his parents on the farm. Until he took up an apprenticeship in Hudiksvall.\r\n        After his apprenticeship he emigration to the United States.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"dropcap\" style=\"text-align: justify\">\r\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have discovered that Nils did had siblings, five to be exact.\r\n        Three brothers and two sisters. One of the girls died at an early age (6 months).\r\n        This would have been before Peter was born. Family planning was not heard of in\r\n        the 1800's. And the more children you could raise, meant more help on the farm or\r\n        the bigger your business could grow. Not to mention just propagating the family\r\n        name. It's only in recent times do we limit out families to one or two children.\r\n        As for Nils's profession. The census records have him listed as a shoemaker. And\r\n        it would appear that this is the apprenticeship trade that he took up in\r\n        Hudiksvall. At this time in history the patronymic naming system was in use. The\r\n        male children would take on the father's first name. And add son to the beginnings\r\n        or the end of the name. The females would take the father's first name and add\r\n        'dotter' to the end of the name. Nils Pitt's name was originally Nils Pitt\r\n        Johansson. Taking on the father's first name (Johan) and adding 'son' to it.Prior\r\n        to leaving for America Nils would change his name to Falkman. This was a common\r\n        practice in the military. There would be so many Johanssons or Nilssons in a\r\n        company or regiment, that they would have changed some names. Nils Johansson\r\n        became Nils Falkman. And his brother who was Johan Johansson, became Johan\r\n        Lofgren. The records show that Nils and Karin Noren would both travel to\r\n        Hudiksvall (at different times). And that this time would be overlapping. It\r\n        appears that there, in Hudiksvall, is where Nils received his formal training as a\r\n        shoemaker. And Karin would learn a seamstress trade. I think, this is where Nils\r\n        would eventually meet Karin. Maybe they lived at the same boarding house. Or ate\r\n        at the same restaurant. Or maybe they met in church. Anyway their relationship\r\n        grew. And as time went by Nils would see more and more of Karin. It would appear\r\n        that they had fallen in love and had made a pack together. This pack would be that\r\n        Nils would travel to America and Karin would follow as soon as possible. (less\r\n        that a year later).\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n      <h2 style=\"font-size: 1.5em\">The Journey</h2>\r\n      <p class=\"info\">\r\n        Now back in the 1800's, travel wasn't as easy as it is today. No planes, and the\r\n        railroads were just coming into existence. And also traveling a great distance\r\n        wasn't to be taken on lightly. Many emigrants died on their migration trip to\r\n        America, Canada or Australia. And also it was rather expensive. I'm sure that Nils\r\n        and Corine both had to save up for their pending trip. Maybe taking a year or\r\n        more. Or even borrowing some of the money from family members. With the promise to\r\n        repay the loan when they reached America. (Which we all know, had streets paved\r\n        with gold... Ha Ha). I can almost feel Nils's excitement when he finally had\r\n        enough money to purchase his ticket. He would have gone off to see the 'ticket\r\n        agent' from whom he would have purchased a <u>one-way</u> ticket to America. The\r\n        ticket agent would have arranged all of the travel plans. Much like our 'travel\r\n        agents' of today. There would have been coach or train transportation to the boat.\r\n        The boat fare itself and any lodging expenses that would have been incurred. And\r\n        so it was that on Tuesday, the 6<sup>th</sup> of October 1891, Nils shook his\r\n        father's hand and gave his mother one last hug. Then he said 'Good-Bye' to the\r\n        rest of the family members present. And off he would go to start his journey. He\r\n        left from Svenshult (<span style=\"background-color: #ffff00\"\r\n          >See the link under <u>Places</u></span\r\n        >) on the eastern coast of Sweden. It would have been a cool, crisp morning and\r\n        Nils would have been anxious to start. For this would be a long journey. A journey\r\n        of a life-time. He wouldn't have a chance to see Karin. As she lived over 40 miles\r\n        away and had to attend to her family chores. Nils would have either traveled by\r\n        train or stage coach. Had he traveled by train it would have been an all day\r\n        excursion. Arriving in Göteborg later that evening (<span\r\n          style=\"background-color: #ffff00\"\r\n          >See <a href=\"/Göteborg\"> Göteborg</a> under </span\r\n        ><u><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00\">Travel Notes</span></u\r\n        >). Or even the next day, had Nils traveled by coach, because it would have been\r\n        even a slower journey. Not arriving until the 8th of October. However he traveled,\r\n        Nils did arrive in time and boarded the ship on the 8th of October. And set sail\r\n        for Kingston upon Hull on the 9th. Nils traveled on the S.S. Romeo. A steamship\r\n        built and owned by the Wilson Steamship Line.(<span\r\n          style=\"background-color: #ffff00\"\r\n          >More under </span\r\n        ><u> <span style=\"background-color: #ffff00\">Transportation</span>)</u>.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"info\">\r\n        Upon arriving in <a href=\"/Hull\"> Kingston upon Hull</a>, Nils would have more than likely stayed on\r\n        board the ship until transportation was available for the trip to Liverpool (<span\r\n          style=\"background-color: #ffff00\"\r\n          >See Kingston on Hull, under </span\r\n        ><u><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00\">Travel Notes</span></u\r\n        >) Once transportation was available, Nils would have boarded a train. Along with\r\n        the other passengers headed to Liverpool. And the second leg of his journey would\r\n        begin. Upon arrival in Liverpool, he would have headed down to the docks. And\r\n        boarded the R.M.S. Britannic. Which would take him across the Atlantic and into\r\n        New York City. His ship would have docked at Castle Garden. This is where all of\r\n        the immigrants came through prior to Ellis Island. From there he would have\r\n        boarded a train at Grand Central Depot. And headed to DuBois Pennsylvania. Where\r\n        his brother would be waiting.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n      <h2 style=\"font-size: 1.5em\">Karin Noren</h2>\r\n      <p class=\"imglft\">\r\n        <img\r\n          alt=\"Photograph of Karen Falkman.\"\r\n          height=\"275\"\r\n          src=\"@/assets/img/Karen.jpg\"\r\n          width=\"215\"\r\n        />\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"info\">\r\n        Corine Noren (as it was spelled on some of her immigration papers). 'Katherine',\r\n        as she was call in America. Lived in as small centrally located eastern town named\r\n        Arbrä. It is located about 42 miles from Hudiksvall, the same town where Nils was\r\n        doing his apprenticeship.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"info\">\r\n        Katherine Noren immigrated to America in May of 1892. She left her home in Arbrå\r\n        and traveled to Göteborg the same as Nils. From there, she traveled on the SS\r\n        Norden. Which took her to Hamburg, Germany. From Hamburg she traveled overland to\r\n        Bremen. And it was from Bremen that she boarded the SS Trave. Which took her to\r\n        America. Upon her arrival in New York she took a train directly to DuBois,\r\n        Pennsilyania. This leads me to believe that they must have known one another while\r\n        still in Sweden. There on the 25th of May 1892, she was married, to Nils.&nbsp;\r\n        Her first child was born in September of 1893 (Herman). Shortly after Herman's\r\n        birth the family decided to move to Chicago, Illinois.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"info\">\r\n        Katherine's Father was a 'self ordained minister' (in Sweden). And he, along with\r\n        several other ministers formed a new church. It was called the Swedish Covenant\r\n        Church. He was also educated as a professional&nbsp; cabinet maker. Katherine was\r\n        also employed, as a maid, at the time. It is not an uncommon practice for a\r\n        daughter to accompany her father on his missionary circuit. I think this is what\r\n        Katherine did. Taking in laundry to earn a few cents and also taking care of her\r\n        fathers needs (cooking and washing), as he traveled on his circuit. This may also\r\n        explain how she came to meet Nils Peter. He may have seen her at one of the church\r\n        functions. They started talking and Peter told her of his forth coming trip to\r\n        America. He may have even asked her to accompany him on his trip. I don't know how\r\n        long the two had know each other before making the decision to go to America.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"info\">\r\n        I think Katherine had a stepmother... This information was confirmed by my cousin,\r\n        Karin, who lived with Katherine, (her grand-mother), when she was a small child.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"info\">\r\n        After moving to Chicago. Her husband, Nils Peter, opened up a small shoe shop.\r\n        Making and selling shoes and also repairing them. His first shop was located in\r\n        'downtown' Chicago. And then later on he moved and opened up another shop&nbsp;\r\n        farther west, on Lake Street. Several years later. Nils closed the shop. And\r\n        started working for the Chicago and Oak Park&nbsp; Rail Road. Today called the\r\n        'CTA' or Rapid Transit. Where he was eventually killed in a work related accident.\r\n        With the insurance money Katherine purchased a home in the Austin area of Chicago.\r\n        This is were the children were raised and went to school. Katherine lived the rest\r\n        of her life in the home.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"info\">\r\n        Unfortunately my earliest memories of Katherine are when she was sick and confined\r\n        to bed. Her two daughters Lillian and Ester remained in the home. Never marrying.\r\n        Ester would take care of her mother and Lillian would be the one that was out\r\n        working. &nbsp;\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p class=\"info\" style=\"text-align: center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <BackToTop />\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n  #family_history {\r\n    background-color: linen;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  #content {\r\n    margin-right: auto;\r\n    margin-left: auto;\r\n    padding: 5px;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    vertical-align: top;\r\n    width: 98%;\r\n  }\r\n  .info {\r\n    text-indent: 24px;\r\n    text-align: justify;\r\n    margin-top: 0em;\r\n    margin-bottom: 1em;\r\n  }\r\n  #leftnav,\r\n  #rightnav {\r\n    color: rgb(0, 128, 100);\r\n    background-color: bisque;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    z-index: 22;\r\n    position: relative;\r\n  }\r\n  h1 {\r\n    z-index: 0;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n","import script from \"./FamilyHistory.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./FamilyHistory.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./FamilyHistory.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=326acc6f&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['__scopeId',\"data-v-326acc6f\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["clockText","ref","tday","tmonth","GetClock","d","Date","nday","getDay","nmonth","getMonth","ndate","getDate","nhour","getHours","nmin","getMinutes","nsec","getSeconds","value","setInterval","__exports__","ulList","route","text","llList","urList","lrList"],"sourceRoot":""}
