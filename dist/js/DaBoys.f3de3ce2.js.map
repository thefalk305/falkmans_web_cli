In each family there is one who seems called to find the ancestors.\n    To put flesh on their bones and make them live again. To tell the family story and to\n    feel that somehow they know and approve. Doing genealogy is not a cold gathering of\n    facts but, instead, breathing life into all who have gone before. We are the story\n    tellers of the tribe. All tribes have one. We have been called, as it were, by our\n    genes. Those who have gone before cry out to us: Tell our story. So, we do. In finding\n    them, we somehow find ourselves. How many graves have I stood before now and cried? I\n    have lost count. How many times have I told the ancestors, 'You have a wonderful\n    family; you would be proud of us.'. How many times have I walked up to a grave and\n    felt somehow there was love there for me? I cannot say. It goes beyond just\n    documenting facts. It goes to who I am, and why I do the things I do. It goes to\n    seeing a cemetery about to be lost forever to weeds and indifference and saying - I\n    can't let this happen.<br /><br />\n    Click on one of the images to get a bio of one of da'boys.\n    <br /><br />\n    Click on 'Show Relatives' to see the parents, spouse, siblings and children.<br /><br />Click\n    on a Relative to see their bio.\n  </h2>\n  <div class=\"image-containers\">\n    <div id=\"brothersData\" v-for=\"item in brothersData\" :key=\"item.id\">\n      <div class=\"spacer\" style=\"height: 132px\"></div>\n      <ImageContainer :recordData=\"item\" :fromDaBoys=\"true\" />\n      <!-- <ImageContainer :recordData=\"item\" :infoTable=\"infoTable\" /> -->\n\n      <Relatives v-if=\"showRelatives\" :recordData=\"item\" :infoTable=\"infoTable\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\n  .image-containers {\n    /*\n    position: relative;\n    top: 134px;\n    */\n    display: flex;\n    height: 1060px;\n    width: 100%;\n    justify-content: center;\n\n    /*\n  border: solid black 5px;\n  background-color: antiquewhite;\n  opacity: 0.9;\n  border-radius: 30px;*/\n  }\n\n  .container:hover {\n    cursor: pointer;\n  }\n</style>\n","import script from \"./DaBoys.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./DaBoys.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./DaBoys.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=4dbac577&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['__scopeId',\"data-v-4dbac577\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["showRelatives","props","hideRelatives","brothersData","infoTable","inject","i","__exports__"],"sourceRoot":""}
