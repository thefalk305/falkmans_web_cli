      <h1>Nils Pitt Falkman Emigrates from Sweden to the U. S.</h1>

        Nils's story starts back in the mid 1800's. Records indicate that he was born on
        Thursday, April 30<sup>th</sup> 1863. He was born in Svenshult. This would be the
        farm that his family lived on. Which is located in the parish of Hinneryd.
        Hinneryd lies in the county of Kronoberg. And Kronoberg is one of three counties
        in the province of Småland. In the southern part of Sweden. His parents were Johan
        Nilsson and Karna Persdotter. They were 'Sharecroppers'. Working the land for a
        wealthy land owner. And in return, given a cottage and a parcel of land to work
        for themselves. When Nils turned 18 or 19 he was more than likely conscripted into
        the military. Back in the 1800's it was mandatory. Much like our 'draft' we had in
        the United States. After his time in the military he returned home and he lived
        with his parents on the farm. Until he took up an apprenticeship in Hudiksvall.
        After his apprenticeship he emigration to the United States.
      </p>
      <p class="dropcap" style="text-align: justify">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have discovered that Nils did had siblings, five to be exact.
        Three brothers and two sisters. One of the girls died at an early age (6 months).
        This would have been before Peter was born. Family planning was not heard of in
        the 1800's. And the more children you could raise, meant more help on the farm or
        the bigger your business could grow. Not to mention just propagating the family
        name. It's only in recent times do we limit out families to one or two children.
        As for Nils's profession. The census records have him listed as a shoemaker. And
        it would appear that this is the apprenticeship trade that he took up in
        Hudiksvall. At this time in history the patronymic naming system was in use. The
        male children would take on the father's first name. And add son to the beginnings
        or the end of the name. The females would take the father's first name and add
        'dotter' to the end of the name. Nils Pitt's name was originally Nils Pitt
        Johansson. Taking on the father's first name (Johan) and adding 'son' to it.Prior
        to leaving for America Nils would change his name to Falkman. This was a common
        practice in the military. There would be so many Johanssons or Nilssons in a
        company or regiment, that they would have changed some names. Nils Johansson
        became Nils Falkman. And his brother who was Johan Johansson, became Johan
        Lofgren. The records show that Nils and Karin Noren would both travel to
        Hudiksvall (at different times). And that this time would be overlapping. It
        appears that there, in Hudiksvall, is where Nils received his formal training as a
        shoemaker. And Karin would learn a seamstress trade. I think, this is where Nils
        would eventually meet Karin. Maybe they lived at the same boarding house. Or ate
        at the same restaurant. Or maybe they met in church. Anyway their relationship
        grew. And as time went by Nils would see more and more of Karin. It would appear
        that they had fallen in love and had made a pack together. This pack would be that
        Nils would travel to America and Karin would follow as soon as possible. (less
        that a year later).

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em">The Journey</h2>
      <p class="info">
        Now back in the 1800's, travel wasn't as easy as it is today. No planes, and the
        railroads were just coming into existence. And also traveling a great distance
        wasn't to be taken on lightly. Many emigrants died on their migration trip to
        America, Canada or Australia. And also it was rather expensive. I'm sure that Nils
        and Corine both had to save up for their pending trip. Maybe taking a year or
        more. Or even borrowing some of the money from family members. With the promise to
        repay the loan when they reached America. (Which we all know, had streets paved
        with gold... Ha Ha). I can almost feel Nils's excitement when he finally had
        enough money to purchase his ticket. He would have gone off to see the 'ticket
        agent' from whom he would have purchased a <u>one-way</u> ticket to America. The
        ticket agent would have arranged all of the travel plans. Much like our 'travel
        agents' of today. There would have been coach or train transportation to the boat.
        The boat fare itself and any lodging expenses that would have been incurred. And
        so it was that on Tuesday, the 6<sup>th</sup> of October 1891, Nils shook his
        father's hand and gave his mother one last hug. Then he said 'Good-Bye' to the
        rest of the family members present. And off he would go to start his journey. He
        left from Svenshult (<span style="background-color: #ffff00"
          >See the link under <u>Places</u></span
        >) on the eastern coast of Sweden. It would have been a cool, crisp morning and
        Nils would have been anxious to start. For this would be a long journey. A journey
        of a life-time. He wouldn't have a chance to see Karin. As she lived over 40 miles
        away and had to attend to her family chores. Nils would have either traveled by
        train or stage coach. Had he traveled by train it would have been an all day
        excursion. Arriving in Göteborg later that evening (<span
          style="background-color: #ffff00"
          >See <a href="/Göteborg"> Göteborg</a> under </span
        ><u><span style="background-color: #ffff00">Travel Notes</span></u
        >). Or even the next day, had Nils traveled by coach, because it would have been
        even a slower journey. Not arriving until the 8th of October. However he traveled,
        Nils did arrive in time and boarded the ship on the 8th of October. And set sail
        for Kingston upon Hull on the 9th. Nils traveled on the S.S. Romeo. A steamship
        built and owned by the Wilson Steamship Line.(<span
          style="background-color: #ffff00"
          >More under </span
        ><u> <span style="background-color: #ffff00">Transportation</span>)</u>.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        Upon arriving in <a href="/Hull"> Kingston upon Hull</a>, Nils would have more than likely stayed on
        board the ship until transportation was available for the trip to Liverpool (<span
          style="background-color: #ffff00"
          >See Kingston on Hull, under </span
        ><u><span style="background-color: #ffff00">Travel Notes</span></u
        >) Once transportation was available, Nils would have boarded a train. Along with
        the other passengers headed to Liverpool. And the second leg of his journey would
        begin. Upon arrival in Liverpool, he would have headed down to the docks. And
        boarded the R.M.S. Britannic. Which would take him across the Atlantic and into
        New York City. His ship would have docked at Castle Garden. This is where all of
        the immigrants came through prior to Ellis Island. From there he would have
        boarded a train at Grand Central Depot. And headed to DuBois Pennsylvania. Where
        his brother would be waiting.

          alt="Photograph of Karen Falkman."
          height="275"

          width="215"
        />
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        Corine Noren (as it was spelled on some of her immigration papers). 'Katherine',
        as she was call in America. Lived in as small centrally located eastern town named
        Arbrä. It is located about 42 miles from Hudiksvall, the same town where Nils was
        doing his apprenticeship.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        Katherine Noren immigrated to America in May of 1892. She left her home in Arbrå
        and traveled to Göteborg the same as Nils. From there, she traveled on the SS
        Norden. Which took her to Hamburg, Germany. From Hamburg she traveled overland to
        Bremen. And it was from Bremen that she boarded the SS Trave. Which took her to
        America. Upon her arrival in New York she took a train directly to DuBois,
        Pennsilyania. This leads me to believe that they must have known one another while
        still in Sweden. There on the 25th of May 1892, she was married, to Nils.&nbsp;
        Her first child was born in September of 1893 (Herman). Shortly after Herman's
        birth the family decided to move to Chicago, Illinois.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        Katherine's Father was a 'self ordained minister' (in Sweden). And he, along with
        several other ministers formed a new church. It was called the Swedish Covenant
        Church. He was also educated as a professional&nbsp; cabinet maker. Katherine was
        also employed, as a maid, at the time. It is not an uncommon practice for a
        daughter to accompany her father on his missionary circuit. I think this is what
        Katherine did. Taking in laundry to earn a few cents and also taking care of her
        fathers needs (cooking and washing), as he traveled on his circuit. This may also
        explain how she came to meet Nils Peter. He may have seen her at one of the church
        functions. They started talking and Peter told her of his forth coming trip to
        America. He may have even asked her to accompany him on his trip. I don't know how
        long the two had know each other before making the decision to go to America.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        I think Katherine had a stepmother... This information was confirmed by my cousin,
        Karin, who lived with Katherine, (her grand-mother), when she was a small child.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        After moving to Chicago. Her husband, Nils Peter, opened up a small shoe shop.
        Making and selling shoes and also repairing them. His first shop was located in
        'downtown' Chicago. And then later on he moved and opened up another shop&nbsp;
        farther west, on Lake Street. Several years later. Nils closed the shop. And
        started working for the Chicago and Oak Park&nbsp; Rail Road. Today called the
        'CTA' or Rapid Transit. Where he was eventually killed in a work related accident.
        With the insurance money Katherine purchased a home in the Austin area of Chicago.
        This is were the children were raised and went to school. Katherine lived the rest
        of her life in the home.
      </p>
      <p class="info">
        Unfortunately my earliest memories of Katherine are when she was sick and confined
        to bed. Her two daughters Lillian and Ester remained in the home. Never marrying.
        Ester would take care of her mother and Lillian would be the one that was out
        working. &nbsp;
